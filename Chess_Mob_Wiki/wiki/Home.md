# Welcome to the ChessMob!
Welcome to the ChessMob wiki, the definitive source of information for developers of the ChessMob project. Below, you will find a summary of the project and links to some important wiki pages.

## Project Summary
ChessMob got its start in March, 2013 as one of three projects taken on by student teams in Whitworth University's Software Engineering course. The original idea was proposed by Brian Hubbell who has also drawn up some of the artwork and is funding the project.

The idea that Brian had is essentially this: Chess, but where each player has a king and one other type of piece. The number of pieces that a player starts with is determined by the type that they chose: 6 queens, 7 rooks, 9 bishops, 13 knights, or 31 pawns.
